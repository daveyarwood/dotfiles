" Next and Last (from a gist by sjl)

" Motion for "next/last object".  "Last" here means "previous", not "final".
" Unfortunately the "p" motion was already taken for paragraphs.
"
" Next acts on the next object of the given type in the current line, last acts
" on the previous object of the given type in the current line.
"
" Currently only works for (, [, {, b, r, B, ', and ".
"
" Some examples (C marks cursor positions, V means visually selected):
"
" din'  -> delete in next single quotes                foo = bar('spam')
"                                                      C
"                                                      foo = bar('')
"                                                                C
"
" canb  -> change around next parens                   foo = bar('spam')
"                                                      C
"                                                      foo = bar
"                                                               C
"
" vil"  -> select inside last double quotes            print "hello ", name
"                                                                        C
"                                                      print "hello ", name
