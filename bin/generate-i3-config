# The problem I'm trying to solve here is that I want to dynamically assign
# Slack to a particular workspace, depending on whether or not my laptop is
# plugged into my external monitor.
#
# It doesn't look like it's possible to do this dynamically in my i3 config
# because they deliberately don't have any kind of "if" condition. It also
# doesn't look like it's possible to use i3-msg to assign Slack to a particular
# workspace after the i3 config has already been loaded.
#
# As a workaround, this script runs at the start of every terminal session and
# generates my ~/.i3/config file. This way, I can have whatever dynamic logic I
# want in here and manage my i3 config file in terms of a base config file
# (~/.i3/config.base) and this script that has an opportunity to modify it
# however I want.

i3_config_base="$i3_dir/config.base"
i3_config="$i3_dir/config"

mkdir -p "$i3_dir" # just to be safe

cp "$i3_config_base" "$i3_config"

# Assign Slack windows to open in a particular workspace, depending on whether
# or not my laptop is plugged into my external monitor.
