# HACK: This script used to successfully fill in the user name and password
# fields and log in automatically. But then SECU did something that made that
# stop working. It only works if I log in manually. I think they might have some
# "protections" in place to recognize activity that looks like a script/bot
# logging in and reject the request. Either that, or there is some bug in their
# login UI that only manifests when a script is rapidly filling out and
# submitting the form.
