# General preferences

- Do not write code that you do not understand. If you are unsure about how to
  implement something, ask me for clarification.

- When faced with unexpected behavior, do not guess at what the problem is and
  write code that attempts to fix the problem based on your assumption, without
  understanding the exact cause of the problem. If more information is needed,
  implement measures to get more information (e.g. checking log files, adding
  log statements), and always feel free to ask me questions if you feel stuck.

- Write tests for any non-trivial code. Prefer unit tests of pure functions as
  the main method of testing.

- Please feel free to run build and test commands any time you make significant
  changes to the code. Do not ask me to test anything unless you have already
  confirmed that the code builds without errors and (if there are relevant
  tests) the tests are all passing.

- Instead of serving an app locally, ask me to serve it locally.
