# General preferences

- Write tests for any non-trivial code. Prefer unit tests of pure functions as
  the main method of testing.

- Please feel free to run build and test commands any time you make significant
  changes to the code. Do not ask me to test anything unless you have already
  confirmed that the code builds without errors and (if there are relevant
  tests) the tests are all passing.

- Instead of serving an app locally, ask me to serve it locally.
